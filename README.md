In order to "dig" at a certain location, you type in the index of the row, then the column, separated by a comma (whitespace optional). The game "digs" recursively around that location if there are no bombs nearby.

You can continue digging until either you hit a bomb (which is game over) or you've successfully dug up all n-b non-bomb locations (which is victory)!
